                  <div class="video-subtitle font-alt">Aurora is a coastal province facing the Pacific Ocean. It experiences significant rainfall throughout the year and frequently visited by typhoon. At least five typhoons yearly come across the province, which significantly affect the agricultural sector. The weather condition in the province highly damage the farms and major agricultural crop and vegetable products grown in Aurora. The production of high yield and quality vegetables especially the high value crops are tremendously affected.</div>
                  <br>
                  <div class="video-subtitle font-alt">This brought the Aurora State College of Technology to develop a design of a typhoon-resilient vertical indoor farm. The project will be using container vans rather than the conventional greenhouses as housing facility for the farm to protect it from harsh weather conditions. It also aims to showcase the use of soilless technologies such as hydroponics and aquaponics systems, the use of renewable energy to power the water supply and lighting system of the farm, the use of power-saving technologies such as LED and fiber optics to provide the light requirements of crops, and the use of internet-of-things to maintain the optimal conditions inside the farm.
                    At the end of the project, ASCOT expects to produce a typhoon-resilient design of an indoor farm that will ensure a steady supply of high value vegetables in the province all year round.

                    <div class="video-subtitle font-alt">Pampanga State Agricultural University (PSAU) NICER Tamarind R&D Center The Pampanga State Agricultural University (PSAU) Tamarind RDE Center was established in 2010. The Center has generated one registered variety of sweet tamarind ‘Aglibut Sweet’. Processed products have been developed for commercialization. The Center has been quite successful in the commercialization of sweet tamarind at least at the regional level. Meanwhile, sour tamarind is an underutilized crop, but there has been an expanding demand by food processing companies for broth. This program is intended to expand the tamarind industry focusing on sour types in the Philippines. The present tamarind production system is fragmented and unorganized with many intermediaries from farm to market or to processing entities. Pampanga recorded the highest number of trees in Central Luzon, followed by Nueva Ecija. However, food ingredient companies require pods of at least three segments, no breakage and free from molds as quality standard. With the present traditional production system in tamarind households, S&T interventions is deemed necessary to expand the supply of quality pods to meet the quality and quantity requirements for small and medium processing entrepreneurs.</div>
