                  <div class="video-subtitle font-alt">The Municipality of Guiguinto still considers agriculture as one of its primary source of livelihood, wherein the horticulture business is well-known, in particular the propagation and business of ornamental plants for landscape purposes. Currently, there are eighty six (86) registered garden plant farmers in Guiguinto, most of which are members of the Garden City Multipurpose Cooperative. Seeing the great potential of ornamental plant farming, the municipal government of Guiguinto greatly supports the promotion of the ornamental plant business and envisions to establish the whole municipality into the Garden Capital of the Philippines by the year 2025.</div>
                  <br>
                  <div class="video-subtitle font-alt">The collaborative project of DOST 3 and LGU Guiguinto, entitled “Development of the Gardening and Landscaping Industry of Guiguinto, Bulacan thru the Establishment of an Innovative Tissue Culture Laboratory (iLAB) for Sustainable Propragation of Various Ornamental Plants”, aims to provide technical assistance to the ornamental plant farmers in the municipality of Guiguinto through the establishment of a tissue culture laboratory intended for the production and propagation of ornamental plants. The plant tissue culture laboratory will supplement the propagation of ornamental plants by the farmers when they require large scale production of ornamental plants. The project has been approved for funding under the Grants-in-Aid (GIA) program of DOST 3 last September 13, 2019, and a Memorandum of Agreement has been signed between DOST 3 and LGU Guiguinto.
                  <br>
                  Currently, the ornamental plant farmers in Guiguinto employ conventional farm practices such as cuttings, marcotting and grafting. However, such conventional practices have high mortality rates of transplants and may not be applicable for propagating some ornamental plant species. Currently, the ornamental plant farmers are having difficulties propagating some ornamental plants such as Bucida spinosa, Cypress plant (Cupressus family), Creeping Jennifer (Lysimachia nummularia), Ornamental Legumes (Caesalpinioidae, Mimosoidae, Faboideae), among others. In order to help solve this problem, LGU Guiguinto collaborated with the Department of Science and Technology Region 3 for a project which aims to provide technical assistance to the ornamental plant farmers in the Municipality of Guiguinto through the establishment of a tissue culture laboratory intended for the propagation of ornamental plants. To wit:

                  Quick generation of identical mature offspring of one plant with desirable traits, which is applicable for commercial large-scale production of plants;

                  Production of multiple plants in the absence of seeds or pollinators to produce seeds;

                  Production of plants from seeds or stems that may otherwise have low chances of growing;

                  Production of novel hybrids and genetically modified plants with improved agronomic traits; and,

                  Production of plants with greatly reduced chances of transmitting disease, pests and pathogens.

The university has been granted this facility thru the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) Industrial Technology Development Institute (ITDI) High Impact Technology Solutions (HITS) project. The Food Innovation Center has launched 55 new food products as part of its commitment to the DOST-ITDI HITS Project and to the productivity of Central Luzon. The launching was held during the Region 3 Regional Science and Technology Week (RSTW) at Balanga City, Bataan last July 2019.

This retort is simple to operate and cheaper than the industrial versions. It has a modular setup that is ideal for micro-scale processors. The best feature of this retort is shorter process time which translates to lesser expense for utilities, storage, and transportation.

                            </h3>This equipment operates in the principle wherein heat-sensitive materials are dehydrated through sublimation of water content under vacuum conditions. Freezing of the material results to reduction of the surrounding pressure and adding enough heat to allow the frozen water in the material to change directly from solid phase to gas phase. Once the water has been removed through freeze-drying, the dried food or chemicals are often stored in vacuum-sealed packs to keep air and moisture from reaching them

The principle of drying relies fully on evaporation of available moisture. The heat applied affects the food quality by mildly roasting spices and legumes and moderate caramelization of vegetables and fruits.

            As the Coronavirus-19 pandemic continue to negatively affect communities, agriculture-based solutions seem
            to be becoming more and more attractive and viable to address at least one of its most acute effect, that is
            food insecurity especially in urban centers and densely populated rural areas.<br><br>
            Many stories has since come out about the resurgence of interest in communal gardening and urban agriculture
            as a response to possible food shortages brought on by diminished supply as its transport, as do everything
            else are hampered by localized community quarantine. This time around, though, the Department of Science and
            Technology (DOST) in Central Luzon, would like to ensure the sustainability of such undertakings and not
            just for the short term.<br><br>
            In partnership with the Philippine Council for Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources Research and
            Development Council or PCAARRD-DOST, Central Luzon State University, and Provincial Agriculture Office of
            Bulacan, the agency hopes that two communities in Bulacan will soon lead the way towards not only
            sustainable urban agriculture but a showcase of how smart S&T solutions can transform a community into
            vibrant and self-sufficient enterprises.

            In the town of Bustos, the Bahay ay Yaman ni San Martin de Porres, Inc., (BYSMPI), an orphanage located in
            Brgy. Bonga Menor will received a package of assistance comprised of technologies on brown rice production,
            aquaponics, automated solar-powered vertical farming system, native chicken production, and veggie-bread
            production. Around 8 hectares of the orphanage’s property will be used for this purpose. They will also
            received non agri-based assistance in the form of interactive multi-media teaching aids and installation of
            STARBOOKS in order to promote e-learning to the children in the community. The Religious Cathecists of Mary
            School, on the other hand, located in the Rafaela Homes, Brgy. Taal in Pulilan will receive assistance in
            putting up their vertical farming system and edible garden. These technologies can both be adopted for small
            spaces or utilize idle lots commonly found urban communities.<br><br>
            In times of any public health emergency, hunger is a very real threat. As the effective vaccine against the
            Covid-19 disease continue to defy a definite timeline, measures to mitigate the resulting economic fallout
            are essential. We are all in this in the long haul and as stressed by Dr. Julius Caesar V. Sicat, DOST
            Central Luzon Director, “building resilient communities which can minimize their dependence on external
            support for their food on the table, especially in times of possible isolation due to pandemic, is
            imperative to augment dwindling government resources. Not only will these smart S&T-based technologies
            ensure accessibility, availability and affordability of ready supply of food for the table it will also
            ensure healthier nutrition to offset prolonged lack or limited physical activity due to lockdowns. Such
            resilient community can become a model that can be replicated to other localities within the country, and
            thus show how Science and Technology truly works for the People.”
