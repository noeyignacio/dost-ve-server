                                <p>The Florida Association of Persons with Disability (FAPWDs) continuously seek for a
                                    sustainable livelihood that will enable them to help provide for the needs of their
                                    family. As stated in Republic Act No. 7277 Sec. 40, Role of National Agencies and
                                    Local Government Units - Local government units shall promote the establishment of
                                    organizations of disabled persons in their respective territorial jurisdictions.
                                    National agencies and local government units may enter joint ventures with
                                    organizations or associations of persons with disabilities to explore livelihood
                                    opportunities and other undertakings that shall enhance their health, physical
                                    fitness, and the economic and social well-being. Relatively, one of the priority
                                    sectors of CEST is the PWDs. It is in response to the governmentâ€™s National Program
                                    on Poverty Alleviation.<br><br>

                                    The DOST-III through its Community Empowerment through Science and Technology (CEST)
                                    provided a training cum production to the members of the FAPWDs. Through this, the
                                    productivity of the PWDs was improved through the enhancement of their skills and
                                    abilities in handicrafts making specifically on bamboo-based materials.<br><br>

                                    The FAPWDs now have eight (8) members who are ready to start production of their
                                    bamboo-based handicraft products. The LGU on the other hand have committed to aid in
                                    the promotion of the bamboo-handicrafts to be produced by the FAPWDs.
