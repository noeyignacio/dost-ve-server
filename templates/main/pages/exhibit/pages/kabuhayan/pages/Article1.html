                                <p>Filipinos are familiar with the old ditty, “planting rice is never fun,” dramatizing
                                    the backbreaking work of manually planting rice paddies under the scorching heat of
                                    the sun. But while farm mechanization have gained widespread use among our farmers,
                                    most still rely on manual planting as these equipment can be expensive.<br><br>

                                    The Department of Science and Technology (DOST) in Central Luzon hopes to make rice
                                    planting a little less physically exhausting and a lot faster through the use of
                                    pull type rice transplanters. A total of 48 units of these were distributed recently
                                    to selected farmer groups in the region’s seven provinces.<br><br>

                                    The said equipment, which can accommodate 4 rows of simultaneous transplanting with
                                    plant spacing of 20 cm and hill spacing of 18 cm, not only makes transplanting more
                                    efficient but can also reduce the cost of labor during planting season. With the use
                                    of mechanized transplanting technologies, some of the poor rice production practices
                                    in the Philippines can be eliminated, one of which is the improper plant spacing
                                    which prevents the rice plant from achieving maximum tillering levels. Proper
                                    spacing can increase the yield by 25% to 39% over improper plant spacing. This will
                                    allow the rice plant achieve maximum tiller levels and improve its productivity.
                                    Aside from ensuring optimum planting density, seedling stress caused by traditional
                                    uprooting practices are eliminated.<br><br>

                                    The distribution of the transplanters is a component of the SMARTer Hybrid Rice
                                    Production Project Phase 2 under the Expanded Implementation of the Community
                                    Empowerment through Science and Technology (eCEST) program of the agency. Aside from
                                    the transplanters, the technology intervention also include the use of appropriate
                                    hybrid rice variety, double mulching technique in seedling preparation and
                                    carrageenan plant growth promoter which are all aimed at improving the yield per
                                    hectare to up to 200 cavans. The said project is scheduled to be implemented in the
                                    different provinces in the 4th quarter of this year.<br><br>

                                    Expressing his appreciation for the DOST assistance, one of the farmer beneficiaries
                                    from Bataan, Mr. Louel Antonio of Nature’s Farming Association said, “Ang proyektong
                                    ito ng DOST ay isa sa pinakamagandang programang aking nalahukan. Sa pamamagitan
                                    nito (transplanter), mas mapapabilis ang pagtatanim at mababawasan ang gastos sa
                                    pagsasaka”.
