                    P0antabangan, a municipality in the province of Nueva Ecija in Central Luzon is the site of the Pantabangan
                    Dam and Lake. Located in the northern part of Nueva Ecija, Pantabangan is situated at the foot of Mt.
                    Mabilog below Mt. Dalimanok which are found between the Sierra Madre and Caraballo Mountain ranges. The
                    construction of the Dam had great economic and social impact on the lives of Pantabangeños. About 8,100
                    hectares of productive farmlands and the town center along with the seven outlying barangays of Villarica,
                    Liberty, Cadaclan, San Juan, Napon-Napon, Marikit and Conversion had to be submerged under the new lake to
                    make way for the dam. Residents were relocated to higher ground overlooking the vast reservoir, which became
                    the new Pantabangan town center. Despite the dam’s location in the municipality which generates
                    hydro-electric power and irrigation water for Central Luzon, the poverty incidence in the area remains high.
                    The 2012 poverty estimates of the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reveal that Pantabangan has a 19.5%
                    poverty incidence and ranks 7th among 31 municipalities in Nueva Ecija. Many of its barangays have become
                    geographically isolated and therefore disadvantaged because of the dam’s construction.<br><br>
        
                    Recognizing the urgent need to help some barangays in Pantabangan, DOST-III officially adopted the
                    municipality as one of its 25 CEST-assisted communities through its regional program on the Expanded
                    Implementation of Community Empowerment through Science and Technology (CEST) in Region III. To jumpstart
                    the project, the CEST team initially collected socio-economic data about the municipality and its barangays
                    to help identify the pressing issues and areas to be addressed using it as a backdrop to the conduct of the
                    Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) in the community. To get a better assessment of the prevailing conditions in the
                    areas, a multi-sectoral consultative dialogue participated by local/barangay leaders, farmer leaders,
                    barangay health workers (BHWs), barangay nutrition scholars (BNS), and school principals and teachers. As an
                    adjunct tool, the Technology Needs Assessment (TNA) instrument was also used to determine the technical
                    needs of the community in the five (5) entry points of CEST.
