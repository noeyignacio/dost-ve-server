                    For the past years, Filipino farmers face challenges in farming caused by the increasing population and climate change. The need to sustain food security and produce agricultural products of good quality has been a struggle for most farmers as they are deprived with the knowledge and skills to adapt to our changing environment.
        
                    Other than that, fewer and fewer people seem to engage in farming. A lot of our agricultural lands are being converted for industrial purposes. The age of Filipino farmers have become older while their children seem to choose high paying careers instead of farming. The intense labor equating to smaller profit is what largely drives them off of farming. If this keeps on happening, imagine what would happen if the last farmer quits tomorrow?
        
                    With high hopes of reviving agriculture in the country, the eCEST program aimed to empower communities by providing a package of S&T interventions for farmers. Being rice as the staple food of Filipinos, technological interventions were focused on rice production. And since Region 3 is the central rice production of the Philippines, these interventions may help the country to attain rice self—sufficiency.<br><br>

                    With this goal, DOST 3 partnered with the Philippine Sino-Center for Agricultural Technologies (PhilSCAT) identified proper technologies to increase the yield of farmers.  This led to the project entitled “SMART Rice Production” which aims to promote the mechanized hybrid rice production to farmers. This project was first piloted to thirteen (13) demo farms in Central Luzon resulting to an average of 30% increase in yield with a maximum of 175 cavans per hectare. The project makes use of the following technologies:
